A basic C library with very used common functions and wrappers to use common OS functionalities.
The wrappers are OS agnostic between Unix and Windows, and they use OS specific system calls or APIs to achieve that.

It could also link a precompiled static library file after using CMake, and a `CMakeLists.txt` file is provided to make this task easier.

### Documentation

All the documentation for the library is available in Markdown format in the doc folder, and those files refers to the .c and .h files in the `src` and `include` folders. For easier access, click the available links below.
